description: Diagnose and resolve permission denials when Pi Coding Agent runs inside a nono security sandbox. Use this when a tool call, shell command, file operation, extension, package install, or provider request fails with "Operation not permitted", "Permission denied", EACCES, EPERM, landlock, or sandbox-denied errors.
version: 1.0.0
platforms: [macos, linux]

# Working inside a nono sandbox

The user has launched Pi with `nono run --profile <name> -- pi`. nono enforces filesystem and network limits at the OS level before Pi starts. Landlock on Linux and Seatbelt on macOS enforce those rules outside Pi's approval and extension systems.

Pi cannot expand nono access from inside the session. Retries, approval prompts, chmod, chown, sudo, or macOS privacy settings do not grant new nono capabilities.

## When to use this skill

Use this skill when a Pi tool, extension, package install, shell command, MCP subprocess, or provider request fails with:

- `Operation not permitted`
- `Permission denied`
- `EACCES` or `EPERM`
- `landlock`
- `sandbox: deny` or `sandbox denied`

## Diagnosis

1. Identify the concrete blocked path or network action from the failed tool call, stderr, traceback, or command arguments.
2. Run:

   ```bash
   nono why --self --path /the/blocked/path --op read
   ```

3. Use `--op write` for write-only failures and `--op readwrite` when the operation needs both.
4. If `NONO_CAP_FILE` is set, inspect the current sandbox:

   ```bash
   cat "$NONO_CAP_FILE"
   ```

## Remediation options

Present exactly two options to the user.

### Option A: one-off restart

Use this for a path needed only once:

```bash
nono run --profile pi --allow /path/to/needed -- pi
```

Use `--read` instead of `--allow` when Pi only needs view access.

### Option B: profile draft

Create a profile draft under `~/.config/nono/profile-drafts/<name>.json`:

```json
{
  "extends": "pi",
  "meta": { "name": "pi-extra", "version": "1.0.0" },
  "filesystem": {
    "read": ["/path/to/needed"]
  }
}
```

Do not write directly to `~/.config/nono/profiles` from inside the sandbox. Active profiles control future sandbox policy and must stay behind a user review step.

The user reviews and promotes the draft outside the sandbox:

```bash
nono profile validate --draft pi-extra
nono profile promote pi-extra
```

Start future sessions with:

```bash
nono run --profile pi-extra -- pi
```

Use `read_file`, `write_file`, or `allow_file` only for exact single-file grants. Use `read`, `write`, or `allow` for directories.

## Pi-specific notes

- Pi state, package installs, sessions, auth data, and settings live under `~/.pi`. The base nono Pi profile grants this directory read/write because Pi needs its own state.
- The nono Pi pack installs itself as a Pi package by adding the pack directory to `~/.pi/agent/settings.json`.
- Prefer nono credential routes for API keys. Pi's `~/.pi/agent/auth.json` is inside the sandbox because Pi must read it, so real API keys stored there are visible to the sandboxed process.

## Do not do

- Do not suggest Full Disk Access, chmod, chown, or sudo for nono denials.
- Do not retry a blocked tool through a different path.
- Do not tell the user Pi approval can fix a nono denial.
- Do not edit registry-managed package files under `~/.config/nono/packages`; create a profile extension instead.
