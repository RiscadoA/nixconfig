# NixOS configuration

In this repository you can find my NixOS configuration flake.
This configuration was built based mainly on the following resources:
- [hlissner's dotfiles](https://github.com/hlissner/dotfiles);
- [erase your darlings](https://grahamc.com/blog/erase-your-darlings);

I use [Home Manager](https://github.com/nix-community/home-manager).
